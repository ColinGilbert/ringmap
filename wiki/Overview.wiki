= Introduction =
Packet capturing in high-speed networks is not an easy task due to the system limitations like RAM and system bus throughput. Unfortunately, at line-rate speeds, it is often impossible to capture every packet arriving at a network interface. Hardware may not be the only bottleneck, however, as inefficient software is also to blame for poor resources usage and resulting packet loss during capture. Within the context of this project the new software components will be developed in order to improve the performance of packet capturing in [http://www.freebsd.org FreeBSD].


= Project Goal =
Implementation the new software components for efficient packet capturing at 1Gb and 10Gb in _FreeBSD_. The new software should make it possible to minimize packet loss and CPU load during packet capture. These software components have to be realized as the new *ringmap* FreeBSD packet capturing stack and have to be based on:
 * generic network drivers: 
  * currently supported drivers: 
   * [http://www.freebsd.org/cgi/man.cgi?query=em&manpath=FreeBSD+7.0-RELEASE em] for 1GbE and [http://www.freebsd.org/cgi/man.cgi?query=ixgbe&manpath=FreeBSD+8.0-RELEASE ixgbe] for 10G capturing
 * _libpcap_
  * the new functions have to be developed for _libpcap_ to accessing packets by using _ringmap_. 
Also the system calls have to be implemented in order to control the sniffing process. The new implemented software must be transparent for user-space applications. Namely, each application that uses _libpcap_ for packet capturing shouldn't require modification in order to run with the new _ringmap_ network driver and new modified _libpcap_. 


= Definitions = 
*Packet capturing stack:* the software used for capturing packets 
 * Network adapter driver
 * Software to analyze and filter received packets
  * [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berkeley_Packet_Filter Berkeley Packet Filter]
 * Software to  access received packets from user-space
  * mostly based on _[http://www.tcpdump.org/ libpcap]_ library 

= Supported Hardware ==
 * Gigabit Ethernet adapters based on the following Intel controller chips:
  * _8254x, 8257x, 8259x_

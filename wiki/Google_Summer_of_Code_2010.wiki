#summary Project Ideas for Google Summer of Code 2010

<wiki:toc max_depth="2" />

= Introduction =
This page contains a list of ideas for the [http://code.google.com/soc/ GSoC]-Program. We hope to achieve through participation in the GSoC the following goals:
 * Furthering the development of the ringmap Project
 * Porting the ringmap codebase to new, different hardware architectures
 * Implementing new features into ringmap

= Idea-List = 

== Porting the ringmap capturing stack to FreeBSD-8 ==

Technical Contact: Jan Böttger

At the present time, ringmap can be run only on FreeBSD-7.x. Our task here would be to port the existing codebase to FreeBSD-8.x. The porting effort would involve both the driver and libpcap source code.

Requirements:
    * Strong knowledge of C.
    * Understanding of kernel debugging.


== Porting ringmap to 10GbE Intel Network Adapters ==

Technical Contact: Jan Böttger

Motivation:
 * 10gbit networks are in operation
 * Monitoring and capturing hardware is expensive
 * A monitoring and capturing solution utilizing commodity hardware is appealing

Requirements:
 * Improving the BSD capturing performance (see thesis as reference)
 * The development platform and testbed is provided by FG INET at TU-Berlin
 * Measurement results will be made available

Goals:
 * Achieve a working and tested driver for use on 10 Gigabit Ethernet adapter.



== Optimizing the storage of captured packets on the hard drive ==


  
== Implementing Load-Balancing functionality for ixgb driver ==

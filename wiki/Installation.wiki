= Installing ringmap =
Before you start to install ringmap, familiarize yourself with: 
 * [http://www.freebsd.org/doc/en_US.ISO8859-1/books/handbook/updating-upgrading.html Updating and Upgrading FreeBSD]
 * [http://www.freebsd.org/doc/en_US.ISO8859-1/books/handbook/kernelconfig.html Building and Installing a Custom Kernel]
  	
Following steps are required before you install ringmap:
 * Be sure you have in /usr/src the base system and the kernel source. 

 * Recompile your kernel without "em" driver: 
  * remove from the kernel config file the line "device em"
  * compile and install the kernel

 * Get the ringmap source code from SVN or [http://code.google.com/p/ringmap/downloads/list download list]
 * Put folowing lines into the /etc/make.conf:
  * EM_RINGMAP=yes
  * LIBPCAP_RINGMAP=yes

 * Change to the scripts/ directory. There you'll find scripts for building and installing the ringmap. Read the README in that directory for further information.

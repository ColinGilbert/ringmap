**Ringmap** is a complete _[FreeBSD](http://www.freebsd.org)_ packet capturing stack specialized for very high-speed networks. Conventional packet capturing software often suffers packet loss at high data rates close to 1Gb/sec or greater. Ringmap takes significant measures to minimize both packet loss and overall system load during packet capture. The goal of this project is to further develop the new packet capturing software for _FreeBSD_ and integrate it with the generic network drivers and _libpcap_.

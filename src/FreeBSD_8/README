Before you start to install ringmap, be sure you are familiar with: 
- Updating and Upgrading FreeBSD:
	http://www.freebsd.org/doc/en_US.ISO8859-1/books/handbook/updating-upgrading.html
 
- Building and Installing a Custom Kernel:
	http://www.freebsd.org/doc/en_US.ISO8859-1/books/handbook/kernelconfig.html
	
Before you start there are few steps you have to do in your system:
1. Be sure you have in /usr/src the base system and the kernel source. 

2. Recompile your kernel without "em" driver: 
	- remove from the kernel config file the line "device em"
	- compile and install the kernel

3. Get the ringmap source code from
	a. SVN: svn checkout http://ringmap.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/ ringmap-read-only
	or 
	b. tarball: http://code.google.com/p/ringmap/downloads/list

4. Put folowing lines into the /etc/make.conf:
	EM_RINGMAP=yes
	LIBPCAP_RINGMAP=yes

5. Change to the scripts/ directory. There are scripts for building and
installing the ringmap.  Read the README in that directory for further
information.

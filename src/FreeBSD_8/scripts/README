unload_ringmap.sh	-	unload ringmap kernel moduile and install generic libpcap
build_ringmap.sh	-	builds the kernel code and libpcap
set_ringmap.sh		- 	loads the driver module and installs libpcap

In oder to install ringmap, first you have to build sorces and then 
install built binaries: 

	% chmod 755 build_ringmap.sh set_ringmap.sh unload_ringmap.sh
	% ./build_ringmap.sh


After the code is compiled do following steps:

	% sudo ./set_ringmap.sh
	% sudo ifconfig <IFACE> monitor up

<IFACE> is a string that represent your network interface

Now you can start any capturing application that based on libpcap, 
e.g. tcpdump, wireshark.

It is very important to set interface into the "monitor" mode before 
capturing. After, if you want to use the network interface for other
things, first unset monitor mode. Then unload ringmap executing:

% sudo ./unload_ringmap.sh

... then install and load a generic driver for your network adapter.

build_ringmap.sh	-	builds the kernel code and libpcap
set_ringmap.sh		- 	loads the driver module and installs libpcap

In oder to install ringmap, first you have to build sorces and then 
install built binaries: 

	% chmod 755 build_ringmap.sh set_ringmap.sh
	% ./build_ringmap.sh


After the code is compiled do following steps:

	% sudo ./set_ringmap.sh
	% sudo ifconfig <IFACE> monitor up

<IFACE> is a string that represent your network interface

Then you can start any capturing application that based on libpcap, 
e.g. tcpdump, wireshark.

It is very important to set interface into the "monitor" mode before 
capturing.

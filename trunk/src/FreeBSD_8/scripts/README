unload_ringmap.sh	-	to unload ringmap kernel module and 
						install generic libpcap

build_ringmap.sh	-	to build the kernel code and libpcap

set_ringmap.sh		- 	to load the ringmap-driver module and 
						install ringmap-libpcap


In oder to install ringmap, first, you have to compile the source code: 

	% chmod 755 *.sh
	% ./build_ringmap.sh


After the code is compiled do following steps:

	% sudo ./set_ringmap.sh
	% sudo ifconfig <IFACE> monitor up

<IFACE> is a string that represent your network interface

Now you can run any capturing application based on libpcap, 
e.g. tcpdump, wireshark, etc...

It is very important to set interface into the "monitor" mode before 
capturing. Afterwards, if you want to use the network interface for other
tasks, first unset monitor mode, then unload ringmap by executing:

% sudo ./unload_ringmap.sh

... then install and load a generic driver for your network adapter.
